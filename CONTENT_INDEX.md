# CONTENT_INDEX.md

## How To Use This File

Use this index to find the current role of each URL before editing. Update it whenever URLs, page roles, metadata, CTAs, schema, or internal-link responsibilities change.

## Page Inventory

The rows below are the primary-locale baseline. Localized versions keep the same
`translationKey`, use their configured locale prefix, and must appear in canonical,
hreflang, sitemap, and route-manifest validation.

## Generated Route Families

- Fixed and tool pages: authored in `src/data/pages/*.ts` with explicit locale and final URL.
- Entity Hubs and details: generated from `src/data/entities.ts` and the generic renderer in `src/lib/entities.ts`.
- Final route inventory: `npm run routes:manifest`.
- Secondary-locale routes use the prefix configured in `src/data/site.ts`; the primary locale remains on root paths.

## Content Clusters

- Launch facts: `/release-date`, `/steam`, `/dlc-editions`, `/faq`
- Official facts and safe guide structure: `/wiki`, `/guides`
- Evergreen hub and trust: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms`
